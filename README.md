# Bookmark Shortcuts

This Chrome Extension lets you quickly open bookmarks with
configurable shortcut keys.

The default shortcut keys are `Alt+1`, `Alt+2` and `Alt+3`. To
configure a bookmark to be opened with `Alt+1`, put the string
`[Alt+1]` (including the brackets) in the title of the bookmark. If
multiple bookmarks have the tag, the shortcut key will open them all.

You can configure the shortcut keys on the [Chrome Extensions page](chrome://extensions).
